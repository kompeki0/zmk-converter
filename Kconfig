    depends on BT && BT_CENTRAL && BT_OBSERVER && BT_GATT_CLIENT
    help
      Connect to a fixed BLE HID keyboard and subscribe to HID Input
      Report notifications, then print incoming reports in logs.

config ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER_TARGET_MAC
    string "Target MAC address"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default "dd:75:7b:9c:8a:1f"
    help
      Target device address in xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx format.

    bool "Target address type is public"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default n
    help
      If disabled, target address type is treated as random/static random.

    int "Log level"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    range 0 4
    default 3

      0=OFF, 1=ERR, 2=WRN, 3=INF, 4=DBG.

    bool "Log all scan events"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default y
    help
      Log every received advertising packet address/type/RSSI while scanning.

    bool "Forward keyboard usages as ZMK key events"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default y
    help
      Parse standard 8-byte keyboard input reports and emit press/release
      events through ZMK so the board can output to the host.

config ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER_EMIT_POSITION_EVENTS
    bool "Emit virtual kscan events (positions) for keymap remapping"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default y
    help
      Convert incoming HID keyboard usages into virtual matrix row/col events
      so they flow through the normal ZMK keymap/behavior pipeline.

config ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER_CLEAR_NON_TARGET_BONDS_ON_START
    bool "Clear all BLE bonds except target keyboard on boot"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default y
    help
      Remove non-target bonds at startup while preserving the fixed target
      keyboard bond. Useful for re-pairing with host PCs without resetting
      the keyboard link.

config ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER_CLEAR_TARGET_BOND_ON_START
    bool "Clear target keyboard bond on boot"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    default n
    help
      Clear the target keyboard bond on startup. Enable temporarily when
      keyboard pairing gets stuck, then disable again.

    help
      After boot, when an output endpoint is connected, emit key events to type
      the string 'testing'. This is for quickly confirming host connectivity.

config ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER_BLOCK_HOST_ADV_UNTIL_TARGET_CONNECTED
    bool "Block host BLE advertising until target keyboard is connected"
    depends on ZMK_BLE_HOGP_SNIFFER
    depends on ZMK_BLE
    default y
    help
      Stop ZMK's peripheral advertising while waiting for the fixed target
      keyboard connection. Once connected, advertising is resumed so a PC can
      pair/connect.
